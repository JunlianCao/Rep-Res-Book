# Stylistic Convensions {-}

I use the following conventions throughout this book:

-   **Abstract variables**: Abstract variables, i.e. variables that do not
represent specific objects in an example, are in `ALL CAPS TYPEWRITER TEXT`.

-   **Clickable buttons**: Clickable Buttons are in `typewriter text`.

-   **Code**: All code is in `typewriter text`.

-   **Filenames and directories**: Filenames and directories more generally are
printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for file and directory names.

-   **File extensions**: Like filenames, file extensions are *italicized*.

-   **Individual variable values**: Individual variable values mentioned in the
text are in *italics*.

-   **Objects**: Objects are printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for object names.

-   **Object columns**: Data frame object columns are printed in *italics*.

-   **R Function names** are followed by parentheses (e.g., `stats::lm()`)

-   **Packages**: **R** packages are printed in *italics*. System names are not italicized, even if they have an R package by the same name, e.g. R Markdown (System) vs. *rmarkdown* (package).[^system_names]

-   **Windows and RStudio panes**: Open windows and RStudio panes are written in
*italics*.

-   **Variable names**: Variable names are printed in **bold**. I use CamelBack
for individual variable names.
