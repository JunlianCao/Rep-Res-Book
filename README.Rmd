The files in this repository comprise the source code for creating
**Reproducible Research with R and RStudio**.

### File Organization

The main files used to create the manuscript of the book are in the `Source`
folder. This folder contains the parent *knitr* `.Rnw` file in the
`Source/Parent/` directory. Child documents for the book chapters are in the
`Source/Children/` directory and child files for the book's front matter are in
the `Source/FrontMatter/` directory.

### Reproduce the Book

The book can be reproduced by using the R package *knitr*. To do this:

1. Make sure you have [R](http://www.r-project.org/),
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html), and the *knitr* R package
installed on your computer. Also install Andre Simon's
[highlighter utility](http://www.andre-simon.de/zip/download.html).

2. Download this repository and point the directories in the *BookMake.R* make
file to where it is downloaded to.

3. Run the *BookMake.R* make file in R.

Note: To install the R packages used to compile the book make sure to have the [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html) package installed before compiling the book.

**Note:** the LaTeX file will compile with errors and warnings. These are
related to stylistic choices and should largely be ignored. But because of this
you will need to **compile the document a few times** to get the full text
with bibliography and index.

#### Reproducing the Book in Windows.

If you would like to reproduce the book and are using Windows you will need to
install [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/installer.html).
Please use the recommended installation to ensure that your system PATH is set
up correctly. Otherwise your computer will not know where the tools are.

#### Reproducing this Book in Linux

You will need to install the R packages RCurl and XML separately. See
[this post](https://GitHub.com/cboettig/treeBASE/issues/5) for more details.

### Session Info

The current version of the book manuscript was compiled with
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) (v. 1.2.964 developer build) with the
following R session:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
